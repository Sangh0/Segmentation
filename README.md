- Image Segmentation is the task of clustering part.  
- This process is called pixel-level classification.  
- There are threee task: Semantic Segmentation, Instance Segmentation, Panoptic Segmentation.  
- Semantic Segmentation is a task of pixel-wise prediction.  
- Instance Segmentation is a task that classifies the same object into different classes.  
- Panoptic Segmentation is a task that combines Semantic and Instance Segmentation.
